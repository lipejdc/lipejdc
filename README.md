# Hello everyone! 👋

I'm Felipe, a Brazilian backend developer based in Germany.

I started my journey in the IT world in 2021 with an apprenticeship as IT Specialst for Application Development, whicb I successfully comopleted after 3 years. Since then, I have focused on building robust and scalable backend systems  using C#/.NET and ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core.

I have experience applying Clean Architecture principles and working with the MVC pattern in real-world projects. I've developed and maintaned RESTful Web APIs and worked with relational databases such as PostgreSQL and MS SQL, handliong data modeling, queries, and performance considerations.

On the frontend side, I have experience working with TypeScript, React and Next.js to deliver full-stack solutions when needed.

I'm currently open to new opportunities where I can contribute to the development and maintanance of systems.
