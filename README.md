# Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Felipe and I come originally from Brazil. I have been living in Germany for the past 15 years. My journey in the IT world started in 2021 with an apprenticeship in Application Development that I finished 3 years later. There I learned in C#, .NET and ASP.NET Core. I also have basic knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Recently I started a web development bootcamp at neue fische to improve my skills in front-end and learn React, Next.js and other technologies.

## Hobbies:

- Hiking in the mountains
- Cycling
- Reading
- Listening to music
